# Project TODO

This file contains **global project tasks** that are important for all contributors.

## Format

- Use GitHub-style checkboxes: `- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for completed
- Each task should be high-level and project-significant
- Detailed plans live in `todo/*.md` (gitignored, personal)

## Active Tasks

<!-- Add your tasks here -->

## Completed Tasks

<!-- Completed tasks are moved here for reference -->

---

**Note:** For detailed session-specific TODO files, see `.claude/todo/` directory (gitignored).
